  # Introduction

  Everything is made of __something__. Clocks are made of hundreds cogs and screws, software is built from many different peices of code, and no party is complete without a long list of technicians, producers, DJs, and bartenders.

  Nyikit introduces a noval way of doing business, adapting several high level concepts from successful products to create a new commerce platform that mimics how materials and economics behave in real life to reduce friction to a minimum.

  Our vision of the world of tomorrow is of frictionless business operations done a grand scale powered by the crowd for the crowd, delivering not just better experience but also reduced costs and effecient production cycles.

  concepts = """!md
  # Concepts  

  The novelty of the platform arises not from it's complexity, but from it's simplicity combined with powerful capabilities.

  With just a handful of concepts Nyikit is ready to disrupt the commerce space and introduce powerful tools for the consumers and the producers alike.

  Let's begin exploring the building blocks that make Nyikit;
  """

  item = """!md
  ## Item

  The `Item` is the most basic of Nyikit's building blocks - it is the element that users create, modify, sell or buy.

  At it's most basic form, the `Item` contains very simple information; primarily the name, description, owner, dependency items, and relevant contracts.

  Although quite simple on their own, items can be very powerful once combined with the concepts of [dependency items](#item-dependencies) and [collections](#collections).

  ### Item Sale
  Items cannot be sold directly, they can only be sold through a collection, a shop, or as a dependency of another item.

  Items can be sold as a 'one off' sale, for something like a physical item, such as a Playstation game console, or as 'subscription' payment, for something like video subscription service, or as a 'milestone' payment, for something like a project that has a budget that is released to the seller according to milestones, dates, or a user action.

  """

  item-dependencies = """!md
  ## Item Dependencies

  Items can be bought and sold, they also can be bundled with other items and receive a portion of the sale. We call this Item Dependency, one item can be dependant on other items when sold with ease and comfort.

  Once an item has been added to another item as a dependency it will receive ceetain percentage or flat fee for every sale of the item that depends on it.

  This behaviour extends all the way through making it possible to create many different combinations of items.

  To illustrate this consider the following scenario: {{todo:Create Scenario}}.

  """

  shops = """!md
  ## Shops

  Shops are user created and managed lists (collections) of items. They provide a way of shocasing items in certain categories or topics.



  """

  collections = """!md
  ## Collections
  Collections are community created and managed collections of items.

  Collections provide a way to tag and categorize items, as collection specialize in certain subject areas or topics, items can be submitted to collection to create a feed of items that are relevant to that subject.

  ### Item Contract
  Items that are sold through a collection will always have an associated contract attached that dictates what percentage of the sale is attributed to the collection.

  All items within a collection must abide to the same `Item & Collection` contract.

  ### Administration
  A collection is administrated initially by the user(s) who created it, and additionally by any other user that are added to the administration list.

  ### Arbitration
  Items being sold through a collection have an associated Arbitrator attached to them.

  Collection managers may provide a list of default arbitrators, may allow buying items with either only collection-approved arbitrators or to any arbitrator agreed by the seller and the buyer.

  Item dependencies are used to create supply and manufacturing chains.

  Any item in the system maybe be used as a `dependency item` for another item.

  Suppose `Item A` - is a small raw wood supplier in Bangor, Maine. He supplies raw wood materials to neighboughring wood processing plants, and occassionally sells it directly to anyone who needs it.

  Suppose `Item B` is a wood processing plant also located in the outskirts of Bangor, Maine. They produce proccessed lumber for wood workshops.

  Suppose `Item C` is a family operated furniture factory that focuses on butique living room and bedroom furnituring.

  All three items need each other to sustain their business, so they work very hard on creating and maintainig business relationships with one another and their competitors.

  Without Nyikit they are working constantly on finding and establishing those business relationships. They scour the internet for relevant companies and their website, they go to weekend meet-and-greet business saloons, and they keep a ton of business cards, paperwork, and email correspondance with a number of different busiensses that can help them grow their own.

  With Nyikit, they created a new item, `Item D` which is a beautiful living room set that is composed of all the previously mentioned items in the following way:

  ```
  Item D - Living Room Set
    |
    |- Item C1 - 3 seats couch
    |   |- Item B - Proceessed Lumber
    |       |- Item A - Raw Lumber
    |
    |- Item C2 - 2 seats couch
    |   |- Item B - Proceessed Lumber
    |       |- Item A - Raw Lumber
    |
    |- Item C3 - Coffee Table
        |- Item B - Proceessed Lumber
