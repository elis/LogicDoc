<p>  <h2><small><i>or</i> What&#39;s Wrong with Today&#39;s Commerce</small></h2>
  While many fields in our daily lives have advanced greatly in the past couple of decades, many other field remain almost unchanged, some of them unchanged for centuries and millenia.</p>
<p>  One such field is the field Commerce at large. Humans do business today almost exactly like it was done ten thousand years ago.</p>
<p>  Even though we have eBay and Amazon to boast, the way business part is done and the way consumers discover a product remained in the dark ages and still rely on heavy leg work by the producers of goods and marketers and resellers that sell them.</p>
<p>  Supply chains and multi-faceted products are still essentially done the same way - two people meet, discuss a deal, involve their attornies to create a deal, they both sign it, and then they both <em>hope</em> that both sides fulfill their end of the deal as agreed.</p>
<p>  On the other hand consumers are flooded with choices in an everly growing maze of <em>(miss)</em>information that when not neglected to be addressed is partially solved with small communities of specialists and enthusiasts in esoteric or closed forums usually unreachable by the general public.</p>
